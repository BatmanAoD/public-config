public-config
=============

Various config files I want to keep synchronized between working environments. SHOULD NOT contain any proprietary code, OR any code that will be bundled with proprietary code.

config to eventually include directly
-----------

 * .bashrc -- DONE!
   * .aliases
   * .bash_functions.personal
   * .bash_profile
 * .vim
   * .vim73
   * .vimpagerrc
   * .vimrc
 * .zshrc

config files to eventually re-write as generated code
-----------
 * .i3
 * .xmodmap-ld50
 * crontab (how to generate programmatically?)
