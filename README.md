public-config
=============

Various config files I want to keep synchronized between working environments. SHOULD NOT contain any proprietary code, OR any code that will be bundled with proprietary code.

config to eventually include directly
-----------

 * .vim (this dir is auto-generated, I think...but test this)
   * .vimpagerrc -- DONE!
   * .vim73 -- DONE!
   * .vimrc -- DONE!
 * .zshrc

config files to eventually re-write as generated code
-----------
 * .i3
 * .xmodmap-ld50
 * crontab (how to generate programmatically?)

other TODO items
-----------
 * Test stuff on another computer...
 * one-stop-shopping: easy way to install/update all this stuff
